Notes -

Spring Boot works on Spring Framework.
Spring is used to develop applications.

    Jakarta Enterprice Beans (EJB; formerly Enterprise JavaBeans) is also such framework.
    For Web Applications -> STRUTS.
    We use Hibernate to work with databases with the help of ORM.

All the above can be done using Spring. Spring works on POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects). It is an ecosystem.

Prerequisites - 

Knowledge of -
    Core Java
    OOPS
    Exception Handling
    Threads
    Collection API
    JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
    Build Tool (Maven or Graddle)
    Spring ORM (Hibernate also works)
    Servlets/ Spring MVS (Servlets are outdated, Spring MVC is used but MVC runs on a server such as TomCat which is a servlet container)

Tools -
    JDK
    IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, IntelliJ)
    Spring Tool 4 (formerly Spring Tool Suite)

IoC (Inversion of Control) Container - Control the flow of application, object creation. 
DI (Dependency Injection) - A design pattern for IoC. Used for injecting object/s within an object.

For creating even a simple code using Spring, we needed to -
1. Create the Project
2. Configure XML Files
3. Create the Beans
.
.
this is where springboot comes into picture, making this simpler

Springboot is an opinionated framework.

Any object created or managed by Spring are called Beans.
